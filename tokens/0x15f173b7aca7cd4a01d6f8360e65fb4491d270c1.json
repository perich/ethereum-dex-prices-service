  "description": "eReal is for the community, we believe that sharing is a key factor to any successful community, based on that, we'll be offering 99% of all eREAL. With eReal, users can enjoy the features of a decentralized currency, which is free and independent, while still being sure that their private information is protected. Brazil, like many other countries, has suffered the consequences of the 2007 financial crisis. This crisis was largely due to the \"mismanagement\" of central and private banks, the same private banks that during the crisis peak were \"bailed out\" by governments with taxpayers' money, all in the name of \"financial stability\". We want to break this vicious circle and share, not only the money advantages, but also the power, which is invaluably more precious. eREAL is more than a coin, it's a movement in the direction of a shift in power between US and THEM, the elites, the banks, the media and the governments. Together we'll prevail.",
