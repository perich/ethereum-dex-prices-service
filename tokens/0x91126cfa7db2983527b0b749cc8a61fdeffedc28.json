  "description": "DONE is a streamlined means to cut out middle-men and \"hunters\" of donations whose fees far outstrip those given to the DONE token holders via smart contract (potentially 1% of total donations), thereby increasing the value or \"efficiency\" of a donation and decreasing nonprofit organization overhead. It constitutes membership of a team which is incentivized to increase donations to responsible organizations who put their accounting systems on the public blockchain.",
