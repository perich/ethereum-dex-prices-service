Bezop aims to provide an open source and complete solution for running a successful ecommerce business online. Merchants can participate by selling products and services on their self-hosted e-commerce stores (the Bezop DOM) and broadcast orders to the network. Bezop implements a novel Proof of order which lowers the rate of fraud for both a merchant and client using elegantly designed contracts powered by the ethereum blockchain and secured cryptographically. Merchants can collect VAT and accurately manage orders.",
