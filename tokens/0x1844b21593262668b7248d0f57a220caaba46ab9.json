  "description": "Oyster Protocol is a storage protocol that builds on top of the IOTA Tangle (Directed Acyclic Graph). Nodes within the Oyster network us the Tangle as a neutral third party to negotiate work performance, completion, and compensation. Data uploaded via Oyster is ultimately retained across the distributed network topology of the Tangle. This ensures that the data is securely stored in a decentralized manner that exhibits great redundancy and failure resistance. The Oyster Pearl(PRL) is an ERC20 token that exhibits unique qualities that are built upon the smart contract framework of Ethereum. Oyster nodes hunt for Pearls that are embedded across file data structures that are retained on the Tangle. As the nodes search for Pearls via Proof of Work they inadvertently maintain the data on the Tangle, therefore securing it's retention. The Oyster smart contract only allows Pearls to be gradually released from their embedded state, therefore guaranteeing the data's integrity for the correct amount of time.",
