  "description": "The World’s first DAPP to bet on the price of Cryptocurrencies\nEthorse is an Ethereum Smart Contract based DApp for betting on the price of Cryptocurrencies and win from everyone who bets against you. Users bet on a coin/token that performs the best among all the other competing ones in a specific time period. Bets are placed and rewards are claimed using Metamask plugin for Chrome/Firefox or the Ethereum based Mist browser. Being completely secured by the blockchain, no one has control over the race or user funds once a contract is deployed and a race is announced.",
