Having already implemented Industry 4.0 technology, robotics and integrated digitalisation, Dentaprime offers the highest quality dentistry affordable to all people, regardless of their income.\nThe Dentacoin ERC20 token is configured to be used globally by all individuals.\nDentacoin Fundation, the DCN inventor, bought 100% of Dentaprime International PLCs&rsquo; shares thus the disposition over the company will be in the hands of Dentacoin Foundation and will be connected to the blockchain.\nEach DCN represents and participates in the company&rsquo;s shares and dividends. The DCN community will vote for important decisions of the company through an integrated voting system.\nFurther projects are planned:\nThe health data base: In addition to the currency (DCN), the Ethereum blockchain will securely handle all private patient data. Further data will be updatable and accessible to patients.\nThe Insurance: Following treatment, Dentaprime will offer each patient a DCN paid insurance policy for lifelong free dental procedures to prevent all the health consequences related to old-age poverty.\nDentacoin will develop as both, a stable growing international currency and an attractive alternate derivate system for investors.",

The idea is to keep the functionality and design of the platform very user-friendly so everyday people, even the ones who are less computer savvy, find it easy to interact with. You may ask, why one would need CareCoin platform when there is already a platform like gofundme.com. Well, there is no doubt gofundme.com is a great initiative in this approach, however, it lacks a functional mechanism to protect the donors against fraudsters; furthermore, a considerable percentage of donations are deducted as fees before the funds are released to the donees. CareCoin Community promises to develop an autonomous community consensus-driven global donation ecosystem which protects against fraudsters and ultimately eliminates the fees completely so every penny donated by a donor is utilized by the donee.",

Our fresh concept in entertainment for adults is centred around our custom-built broadcast studio which is set out as a party house, in this party house will live 60 models all coming from different parts of the world. Throughout the house there will be up to 100 cameras streaming life inside live, in High Definition, 24 hours per day. Cameras will be placed in all living areas, party and bar areas, swimming pool, gym and spa areas, the outdoor kitchen and hot tub area and in the bedrooms and bathrooms all of which broadcast live pictures and audio to our paying customers. Within the house we will also have up to 30 Live Show rooms. These live show rooms are private rooms where our models perform on camera broadcast to a live audience. Viewers can chat in an open chat room and tip the model at anytime or they can engage in a private show with the model. It is the profit derived from these Live Show rooms that will be distributed quarterly to ROC token holders. Members can vote on what type of weekly party will take place in the house, they can choose for their favourite model to take yoga classes, painting or piano lessons, they can buy roses, perfume and other gifts or they can send their favourite model a bottle of wine and a box of chocolates allowing our members to interact with our models in many different ways. Virtual reality will be implemented at a future stage which will give the user the option to walk through the house and experience life inside in an immersive way all from their own home.",

POLY AI focus on studying and developing AI in Deep Learning &ndash; the field which has brough many applications in the recent times for products from Google, Apple or Facebook. The drawback of Deep learning is that it needs a huge amount of input data for the computer to learn. This process requires time and lots of computing power which only large servers own. If there isn&rsquo;t enough input data or power, everything can&rsquo;t go as wanted, result from the computer will not be precise. POLY AI uses the data storage on the Blockchain, which makes difficulties in hardware for developing and studying disappear completely. Comparing to other uses of cloud computing, the Blockchain is much more safe and secured. With Blockchain, only the uploader can adjust files. No one can access, stop downloading or force delete from the system. With the strongpoints of Blockchain, POLY AI manages to solve difficulties and will be the new breakthrough in studying and developing AI. POLY AI has planned for the first generation of AI &ndash; Poly 1.0 in 2018, with supporting functions for the market such as pricing Bitcoin and trading supports.",

These operations have an initial baseline hashing power of 30 PH/s. This hashrate will be continuously upgraded by allocating proceeds derived from the sale of ORME tokens. Unlike other static (or semi-static) Bitcoin-backed cryptocurrencies (which are historically highly speculative in nature and backed by token sales alone) Ormeus Coin will be backed both by token sales and a geographically diverse industrial cryptocurrency mining operation. This predefined mechanism to facilitate the continual accumulation of hashing power will result in the ORV having a constantly increasing reserve store of Bitcoin which effectively distinguishes ORME as a stable store-of-value.",

Bitcoineum replicates the value semantics of Bitcoin through a novel user-centric mining algorithm while enhancing it with all of Ethereum&rsquo;s native capabilities. Instead of grafting smart contracts and other advanced functionality onto the Bitcoin network, Bitcoineum builds a store of value directly into Ethereum. This new token will have desirable properties vs Ether, but maintains native interoperability and transfer capabilities on Ethereum. Further it will have faster transaction times and lower fees than the native Bitcoin network and be the anchor for an entire ecosystme of value-preserving tokens. A token has unique properties that a base currency does not, it is instructional to think of Bitcoineum as a modular component of a larger currency system where the token represents a fair web-minable base unit that can be used to bootstrap other functionality.",

The bigger the crowd the bigger are the potential returns easily reaching six figures. In simple terms, imagine $100,000+ in returns on 1$ bet by successfully predicting the final score of a football game out of 10 possible outcomes. That is Goal Bonanza and much more.",

For every valid move the players gets one token. Thus, this project puts the human at the centre of value creation, not machines. For every token mined, a supplement coin is generated to sell. These tokens are sold before and after the mining phase through an auction. 100% of the money raised is donated to non-profit-privacy organisations who do good work in the area of protection of privacy.",
